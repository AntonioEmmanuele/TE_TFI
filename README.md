# A Dual-Stage Approach for Explainable Time Series Forecasting in On-Field Cyber-Physical Systems

This repository contains all the necessary resources to replicate the experiments and findings presented in the paper "A Dual-Stage Approach for Explainable Time Series Forecasting in On-Field Cyber-Physical Systems"

## Repository Organization
The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. `dataset/`
This folder contains the **250 preprocessed time series** used in our experimental protocol. These datasets are provided in a ready-to-use format and serve as the input for the proposed dual-stage approach.

### 2. `src/`
The source code for our proposed method is located here. Key components include:
- Implementation of the dual-stage forecasting approach.
- Code for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models.

### 3. `results/`
This directory contains the **figures and visualizations** of the results presented in the paper. These include:
- Comparative performance metrics.
- Graphs and charts illustrating the forecasting accuracy and model behavior.


## Prerequisites
To run the code and reproduce the results, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
